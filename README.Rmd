The goal of `tasi` is to provide the missing API to obtain historical prices for Saudi stocks and TASI (Tadawul All Share Index) as well as easy access to the released financial statements

## Installation

Currently `tasi` is only available on github. You can install the latest version of `tasi` with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("Hussain-Alsalman/tasi")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to obtain and plot  TASI historical performance for the past year:

```{r basic example}

library("tasi")
library("ggplot2")
library("magrittr")

df <- get_index_records("2020-02-03","2021-01-02")
df %>%  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = as.POSIXct(transactionDate), y = previousClosePrice)) + geom_line()

```

This is more sophisticated example using `quantmod` package to create candlesticks chart

```{r sophisticated example,message=FALSE}
library("quantmod")
library("dplyr")
library("xts")
library("tasi")
# Performance of Saudi Aramco company stock 
comp_df <- get_company_records("2020-07-01","2021-02-06",company_symbol = 2222)
comp_df %>%
  df_to_xts() %>% 
  chart_Series()
  
```

## Extracting Financial Statements

Now you can extract any financial statement for any specified company in the Saudi Market. Let see how can we easily extract an income statement for a company

```{r}
library("tasi")
library("dplyr")

income_df <- get_income_statement(1180, period_type = "q") # q stands for quarterly.

opts <-options(knitr.kable.NA = "-")
income_df %>% knitr::kable(format.args = list(big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE))
options(opts)
```
